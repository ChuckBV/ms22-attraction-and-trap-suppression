# Attraction, trap suppression by NOW mesos

ms22-attraction-and-trap-suppression

## Overview

A manuscript being prepared for submission, describing experiments on 
attraction of NOW to one- and two-component meso-dispensers in 2019 and 
crop-destruction trap suppression experiments in 2016. 

## Scripts

### Scripts 1-6: 2016 mating disruption test (trap suppression)
 - script1_*.R: Compares mean males/plot in 4 replicate blocks between
 an untreated control and the remaining 6 treatments (2 formulations * 3 
 dispenser densities) for each of three monitoring intervals. Table and 
 Welch t-test. (Table 1)
 - script2_*.R: Mean trap capture by dispenser density plotted separately
 for period 1 (figs 2A and 2B, saved as combined figure)
 - script3_*.R: GlMM w nb, initially factorial then separate 1-way ANOVAs
 for 1- and 2-component dispensers (for period 1)
 - script4_*.R: Mean trap capture by dispenser density plotted separately
 for period 3 (figs 2A and 2B, saved as combined figure)
 - script5_*.R: GlMM w nb, initially factorial then separate 1-way ANOVAs
 for 1- and 2-component dispensers (for period 3).
 - script6_*.R: Mean and SE with univariate confidence interval (t-test)
 for traps with 2.5 cm segments of 1-component or 2-component dispenser,
 or pheromone monitoring lure.
 - script11_*.R: Provides summary of the daily high and low air temperature
 during the three intervals of the 2016 trap suppression experiment
 
### Scrips 7-10: 2019 attraction comparison using sticky traps
 - script7_*.R: Means and SE for 8 treatments in non-mating disruption orchard. 
 Outputs Table 3.
 - script8_*.R: 1-way mixed-model ANOVA (GLMM w nb) for capture in sticky traps
 in a non-mating disruption orchard.
 - script7_*.R: Means and SE for 8 treatments in mating disruption orchard. 
 Outputs Table 4.
 - script8_*.R: 1-way mixed-model ANOVA (GLMM w nb) for capture in sticky traps
 in a mating disruption orchard.
